#7>German Tanks 
L1 = [38, 17, 59, 42, 97, 120]

# Sort the list to find the maximum observed serial number
L1.sort()

# Find the maximum observed serial number
Max = max(L1)

# Calculate the average gap between observed serial numbers assuming uniform distribution
# This represents the average distance between the 6 observed tanks if they partition the numbers uniformly
Avg_gap = (Max - len(L1)) / len(L1)

# Estimate the maximum tank number N using the observed maximum and the average gap
Estimated_N = Max + Avg_gap

# Print the estimated maximum serial number N
print(Estimated_N)
