#8> Expecting HTH
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the variable x, which represents the expected number of tosses to see HTH
x = symbols('x')

# Set up the equation based on the given probabilities and expected values
# The equation is derived from the problem statement:
# x = (1/2) * (x + 1) + (1/4) * x + (1/8) * (x + 3) + (1/8) * 3
# Each term corresponds to the possible outcomes after each toss and the resulting expected values
equation = Eq(x, (1/2) * (x + 1) + (1/4) * x + (1/8) * (x + 3) + (1/8) * 3)

# Solve the equation for x, which will give us the expected number of tosses
solution = solve(equation, x)

# Output the solution, which is the average number of tosses required to see HTH
