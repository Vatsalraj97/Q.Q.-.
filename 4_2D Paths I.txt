# Calculate the number of unique paths in a 2D grid.
# In a grid where a character moves only right or up, with 6 steps right and 6 steps up (total 12 steps),
# the number of distinct paths is calculated using combinations (binomial coefficient),
# which is the number of ways to choose 6 steps (either right or up) from the total 12 steps.
import math

# Set the number of moves right and moves up
moves_right = 6
moves_up = 6

# Total number of steps
total_steps = moves_right + moves_up

# Use the math.comb function to calculate the binomial coefficient (n choose k)
# Here n is total_steps and k is the number of one type of move (either right or up)
result = math.comb(total_steps, moves_right)

# Print the total number of unique paths
print(result)
